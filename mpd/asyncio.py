"""Asynchronous access to MPD using the asyncio methods of Python 3.

Interaction happens over the mpd.asyncio.MPDClient class, whose connect and
command methods are coroutines.

Some commands (eg. listall) additionally support the asynchronous iteration
(aiter, `async for`) interface; using it allows the library user to obtain
items of result as soon as they arrive.

The .idle() method works differently here: It is an asynchronous iterator that
produces a list of changed subsystems whenever a new one is available. The
MPDClient object automatically switches in and out of idle mode depending on
which subsystems there is currently interest in.

Command lists are currently not supported.


This module requires Python 3.5.2 or later to run.
