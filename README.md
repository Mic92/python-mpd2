python-mpd2
==========

Difference to python-mpd
-------------------------

python-mpd2 is a fork of the python-mpd. It is backward compatible to python-mpd, so it could act as drop-in replacement.
Current features list:

 - python3 support (python2.6 is minimum python version required)
 - support for the upcoming client-to-client protocol
 - adding new commands of mpd v0.17 (seekcur, prio, prioid, config)
 - remove of deprecated commands (volume)
 - methods are explicit declared now, so they are shown in ipython
 - add unit tests
 - documented API to add new commands (see Future Compatible)

I attempted to merge my changes into the original project, but never get a reponse.
If you like this module, you could try contact the original author <jat@spatialrift.net> or join the discussion on the [issue tracker](http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/issues/7/)

Getting the latest source code
------------------------------

If you would instead like to use the latest source code, you can grab a copy
of the development version from git by running the command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/Mic92/python-mpd2.git


Installing from source
----------------------

To install python-mpd from source, simply run the command:

    $ python setup.py install

You can use the *--help* switch to *setup.py* for a complete list of commands
and their options.  See the [Installing Python Modules](http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html) document for more details.


Using packages
--------------
Until the python community adapt this package, here are some ready to use packages to test your applications:

### Debian

just add this line to your */etc/apt/sources.list*:

    deb http://sima.azylum.org/debian unstable main

Import the gpg key as root

    $ wget -O - http://sima.azylum.org/sima.gpg | apt-key add -

Key fingerprint :

2255 310A D1A2 48A0 7B59  7638 065F E539 32DC 551D

Controls with *apt-key finger*.

Then simply update/install *python-mpd2* with apt or aptitude:

### Arch Linux

install [python-mpd2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57738) from AUR

### Gentoo Linux

An ebuid is available in the `laurentb` overlay.

    echo 'dev-python/python-mpd::laurentb **' >> /etc/portage/accept_keywords
    layman -a laurentb
    emerge -av python-mpd


Packages for other distributions are welcome!


Using the client library
------------------------

The client library can be used as follows:

    client = mpd.MPDClient()           # create client object
    client.connect("localhost", 6600)  # connect to localhost:6600
    print(client.mpd_version)          # print the mpd version
    print(client.find("any", "house")) # print result of the command "find any house"
    client.close()                     # send the close command
    client.disconnect()                # disconnect from the server

A list of supported commands, their arguments (as MPD currently understands
them), and the functions used to parse their responses can be found in
*doc/commands.txt*.  See the [MPD protocol documentation](http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/) for more details.

Command lists are also supported using *command_list_ok_begin()* and
*command_list_end()*:

    client.command_list_ok_begin()       # start a command list
    client.update()                      # insert the update command into the list
    client.status()                      # insert the status command into the list
    results = client.command_list_end()  # results will be a list with the results

Commands may also return iterators instead of lists if *iterate* is set to
*True*:

    client.iterate = True
    for song in client.playlistinfo():
        print song["file"]

Each command have a *send_* and a *fetch_* variant, which allows to send a
mpd command and the fetch the result later. This is useful for the idle
command:

    client.send_idle()
    # do something else ...
    events = client.fetch_idle()

Some more complex usage example can be found [here](http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/doc/)

Future Compatible
-----------------

New commands or special handling of commands can be easily implemented.
Use *add_command()* or *remove_command()* to modify the commands of the
*MPDClient* class and all its instances.


    def fetch_cover(client):
        """"Take a MPDClient instance as its arguments and return mimetype and image"""
        # this command may come in the future.
        pass
    self.client.add_command("get_cover", fetch_cover)
    # remove the command, because it doesn't exist already.
    self.client.remove_command("get_cover")
