python-mpd2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mic92/python-mpd2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Mic92/python-mpd2)
===========


*python-mpd2* is a Python library which provides a client interface for the [Music Player Daemon](http://musicpd.org).


Difference with python-mpd
--------------------------

python-mpd2 is a fork of [python-mpd](http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/). It is backward compatible with the original module, so it could act as drop-in replacement (tested with [Sonata](http://sonata.berlios.de/)).

The following features were added:

 - Python 3 support (but you neead at least Python 2.6)
 - support for the upcoming client-to-client protocol
 - support for new commands from MPD v0.17 (seekcur, prio, prioid, config, searchadd,
   searchaddpl)
 - remove deprecated commands (volume)
 - explicitly declared MPD commands (which is handy when using for example [IPython](http://ipython.org)
 - a test suite
 - API documentation to add new commands (see [Future Compatible](#future-compatible))
 - support for Unicode strings in all commands (optionally in python2, default in python3 - see [Unicode Handling](#unicode-handling))
 - configureable timeouts
 - support for [logging](#logging)

If you like this module, you could try contact the original author <jat@spatialrift.net> or
join the discussion on the [issue tracker](http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/issues/7/) so that it gets merged upstream.

Getting the latest source code
------------------------------

If you would instead like to use the latest source code, you can grab a copy
of the development version from Git by running the command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/Mic92/python-mpd2.git


Installing from source
----------------------

To install *python-mpd2* from source, simply run the command:

    $ python setup.py install

You can use the *--help* switch to *setup.py* for a complete list of commands
and their options.  See the [Installing Python Modules](http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html) document for more details.

Getting the latest release
--------------------------

The latest stable release of *python-mpd2* can be found on [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=python-mpd2)

### PyPI:

    $ pip install python-mpd2


Until Linux distributions adapt this package, here are some ready to use packages to test your applications:

### Debian

Drop this line in */etc/apt/sources.list.d/python-mpd2.list*:

    deb http://sima.azylum.org/debian unstable main

Import the gpg key as root

    $ wget -O - http://sima.azylum.org/sima.gpg | apt-key add -

Key fingerprint :

    2255 310A D1A2 48A0 7B59  7638 065F E539 32DC 551D

Controls with *apt-key finger*.

Then simply update/install *python-mpd2* or *python3-mpd* with apt or aptitude:

### Arch Linux

Install [python-mpd2](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=59276) from AUR.

### Gentoo Linux

Replaces the original python-mpd beginning with version 0.4.2 (currently masked):

    echo dev-python/python-mpd >> /etc/portage/accept_keywords
    emerge -av python-mpd


Packages for other distributions are welcome!


Using the client library
------------------------

The client library can be used as follows:

```python
client = mpd.MPDClient()           # create client object
client.timeout = 10                # network timeout in seconds (floats allowed), default: None
client.idletimeout = None          # timeout for fetching the result of the idle command is handled seperately, default: None
client.connect("localhost", 6600)  # connect to localhost:6600
print(client.mpd_version)          # print the MPD version
print(client.find("any", "house")) # print result of the command "find any house"
client.close()                     # send the close command
client.disconnect()                # disconnect from the server
```

A list of supported commands, their arguments (as MPD currently understands
them), and the functions used to parse their responses can be found in
*doc/commands.txt*.  See the [MPD protocol documentation](http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/) for more details.

Command lists are also supported using *command_list_ok_begin()* and
*command_list_end()*:

```python
client.command_list_ok_begin()       # start a command list
client.update()                      # insert the update command into the list
client.status()                      # insert the status command into the list
results = client.command_list_end()  # results will be a list with the results
```

Commands may also return iterators instead of lists if *iterate* is set to
*True*:

```python
client.iterate = True
for song in client.playlistinfo():
    print song["file"]
```

Each command have a *send_* and a *fetch_* variant, which allows to send a
MPD command and then fetch the result later. This is useful for the idle
command:

```python
client.send_idle()
# do something else or use function like select(): http://docs.python.org/howto/sockets.html#non-blocking-sockets
# ex. select([client], [], []) or with gobject: http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/page/ExampleIdle/
events = client.fetch_idle()
```

Some more complex usage examples can be found [here](http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/doc/)


<a id="unicode-handling">Unicode Handling</a>
---------------------------------------------

To quote the mpd protocol documentation:

> All data to be sent between the client and server must be encoded in UTF-8.

### With Python 3:

In Python 3, Unicode string is the default string type. So just pass these strings as arguments for MPD commands and *python-mpd2* will also return such Unicode string.

### With Python 2.x

For backward compatibility with *python-mpd*, when running with Python 2.x, *python-mpd2* accepts both Unicode strings (ex. u"♥") and UTF-8 encoded strings (ex. "♥").

In order for *MPDClient* to return Unicode strings with Python 2, create the instance with the `use_unicode` parameter set to `True`.

Using Unicode strings should be prefered as it is done transparently by the library for you, and makes the transition to Python 3 easier.

```python
>>> import mpd
>>> client = MPDClient(use_unicode=True)
>>> client.urlhandlers()[0]
u'http'
>>> client.use_unicode = False # Can be switched back later
>>> client.urlhandlers()[0]
'http'
```
Using this option in Python 3 doesn't have any effect.

<a id="logging">Logging</a>
---------------------------

By default messages are sent to the logger named `mpd`:

```python
>>> import logging, mpd
>>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
>>> client = mpd.MPDClient()
>>> client.connect("localhost", 6600)
INFO:mpd:Calling MPD connect('localhost', 6600, timeout=None)
>>> client.find('any', 'dubstep')
DEBUG:mpd:Calling MPD find('any', 'dubstep')
```

For more information about logging configuration, see http://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html

<a id="future-compatible">Future Compatible</a>
-----------------------------------------------

New commands or special handling of commands can be easily implemented.
Use `add_command()` or `remove_command()` to modify the commands of the
*MPDClient* class and all its instances.

```python
def fetch_cover(client):
    """"Take a MPDClient instance as its arguments and return mimetype and image"""
    # this command may come in the future.
    pass

self.client.add_command("get_cover", fetch_cover)
# you can then use:
self.client.fetch_cover()

# remove the command, because it doesn't exist already.
self.client.remove_command("get_cover")
```

Thread-Safety
------------

Currently `MPDClient` is **NOT** thread-safe.
As it use a socket internaly, only one thread can send or receive at the time.

But `MPDClient` can be easily extended to be thread-safe using [locks](http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html#lock-objects).
Take a look at `examples/locking.py` for further informations.

Testing
-------

You can test the project using [Tox](http://tox.testrun.org/), this will take
care of testing against all the supported Python versions (at least available)
on our computer,  with the required dependencies:

    $ pip install tox
    $ cd /path/to/python-mpd2
    $ tox
