*python-mpd2* is a Python library which provides a client interface for
the `Music Player Daemon <http://musicpd.org>`__.

Difference with python-mpd
--------------------------

python-mpd2 is a fork of `python-mpd`_.  While 0.4.x was backwards compatible
with python-mpd, starting with 0.5 provides enhanced features which are *NOT*
backward compatibles with the original `python-mpd`_ package.  (see PORTING.txt
for more information)

The following features were added:

-  Python 3 support (but you need at least Python 2.6)
-  support for the upcoming client-to-client protocol
-  support for new commands from MPD v0.17 (seekcur, prio, prioid,
   config, searchadd, searchaddpl)
-  remove deprecated commands (volume)
-  explicitly declared MPD commands (which is handy when using for
   example `IPython <http://ipython.org>`__)
-  a test suite
-  API documentation to add new commands (see `Future Compatible`_)
-  support for Unicode strings in all commands (optionally in python2,
   default in python3 - see `Unicode Handling`_)
-  configureable timeouts
-  support for `logging`_
-  improved support for sticker
-  improved support for ranges

If you like this module, you could try contact the original author
jat@spatialrift.net or join the discussion on the 
`issue tracker <http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/issues/7/>`__ so that
it gets merged upstream.

Getting the latest source code
------------------------------

If you would like to use the latest source code, you can grab a
copy of the development version from Git by running the command::

    $ git clone git://github.com/Mic92/python-mpd2.git

Installing from source
----------------------

To install *python-mpd2* from source, simply run the command::

    $ python setup.py install

You can use the *--help* switch to *setup.py* for a complete list of commands

Packages for other distributions are welcome!

Using the client library
------------------------

The client library can be used as follows::

    >>> client = mpd.MPDClient()           # create client object
    >>> client.timeout = 10                # network timeout in seconds (floats allowed), default: None
    >>> client.idletimeout = None          # timeout for fetching the result of the idle command is handled seperately, default: None
    >>> client.connect("localhost", 6600)  # connect to localhost:6600
    >>> print(client.mpd_version)          # print the MPD version
    >>> print(client.find("any", "house")) # print result of the command "find any house"
    >>> client.close()                     # send the close command
    >>> client.disconnect()                # disconnect from the server

A list of supported commands, their arguments (as MPD currently understands
them), and the functions used to parse their responses can be found in
*doc/commands.txt*.  See the `MPD protocol documentation
<http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/>`__ for more details.

Command lists are also supported using *command\_list\_ok\_begin()* and
*command\_list\_end()*::

    >>> client.command_list_ok_begin()       # start a command list
    >>> client.update()                      # insert the update command into the list
    >>> client.status()                      # insert the status command into the list
    >>> results = client.command_list_end()  # results will be a list with the results

Commands may also return iterators instead of lists if *iterate* is set
to *True*::

    client.iterate = True
    for song in client.playlistinfo():
        print song["file"]

Each command have a *send\_* and a *fetch\_* variant, which allows to send a MPD
command and then fetch the result later. This is useful for the idle command::

    >>> client.send_idle()
    # do something else or use function like select(): http://docs.python.org/howto/sockets.html#non-blocking-sockets
    # ex. select([client], [], []) or with gobject: http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/page/ExampleIdle/
    >>> events = client.fetch_idle()

Some more complex usage examples can be found
`here <http://jatreuman.indefero.net/p/python-mpd/doc/>`_

Range
-----

Some commands support integer ranges as argument.  This is done in python-mpd2
by using two element tuple::

    # move the first three songs
    # after the last in the playlist
    >>> client.status()
    ['file: song1.mp3',
     'file: song2.mp3',
     'file: song3.mp3',
     'file: song4.mp3']
    >>> client.move((0,3), 1)
    >>> client.status()
    ['file: song4.mp3'
     'file: song1.mp3',
     'file: song2.mp3',
     'file: song3.mp3',]

Second element can be omitted. MPD will assumes the biggest possible number then (don't forget the comma!)::
NOTE: mpd versions between 0.16.8 and 0.17.3 contains a bug, so ommiting doesn't work.

    >>> client.delete((1,))     # delete all songs, but the first.


Unicode Handling
----------------

To quote the mpd protocol documentation:

> All data to be sent between the client and server must be encoded in UTF-8.

With Python 3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python 3, Unicode string is the default string type. So just pass these
strings as arguments for MPD commands and *python-mpd2* will also return such
Unicode string.

With Python 2.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For backward compatibility with *python-mpd*, when running with Python 2.x,
*python-mpd2* accepts both Unicode strings (ex. u"♥") and UTF-8 encoded strings
(ex. "♥").

In order for *MPDClient* to return Unicode strings with Python 2, create the
instance with the ``use_unicode`` parameter set to ``True``.

Using Unicode strings should be prefered as it is done transparently by the
library for you, and makes the transition to Python 3 easier::

    >>> import mpd
    >>> client = MPDClient(use_unicode=True)
    >>> client.urlhandlers()[0]
    u'http'
    >>> client.use_unicode = False # Can be switched back later
    >>> client.urlhandlers()[0]
    'http'

Using this option in Python 3 doesn't have any effect.

Logging
-------

By default messages are sent to the logger named ``mpd``::

    >>> import logging, mpd
    >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    >>> client = mpd.MPDClient()
    >>> client.connect("localhost", 6600)
    INFO:mpd:Calling MPD connect('localhost', 6600, timeout=None)
    >>> client.find('any', 'dubstep')
    DEBUG:mpd:Calling MPD find('any', 'dubstep')

For more information about logging configuration, see
http://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html

Future Compatible
-----------------

New commands or special handling of commands can be easily implemented.  Use
``add_command()`` or ``remove_command()`` to modify the commands of the
*MPDClient* class and all its instances.::

    def fetch_cover(client):
        """"Take a MPDClient instance as its arguments and return mimetype and image"""
        # this command may come in the future.
        pass

    self.client.add_command("get_cover", fetch_cover)
    # you can then use:
    self.client.fetch_cover()

    # remove the command, because it doesn't exist already.
    self.client.remove_command("get_cover")

Thread-Safety
-------------

Currently ``MPDClient`` is **NOT** thread-safe. As it use a socket internaly,
only one thread can send or receive at the time.

But ``MPDClient`` can be easily extended to be thread-safe using `locks
<http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html#lock-objects>`__.  Take a look at
``examples/locking.py`` for further informations.

Testing
-------

Just run::

    $ python setup.py test

This will install `Tox <http://tox.testrun.org/>`__. Tox will take care of
testing against all the supported Python versions (at least available) on our
computer, with the required dependencies
